## About this

In the workshop, we'll learn how to make and use basic bioplastics with algae, water, processed extracts from red seaweed and glycerol and take part in a form of ‚Äòcritical making‚Äô, a way of developing a critical perspective on the world by hands on thinking through materials.

 * See how bioplastic can be made with domestic technology
 * Get to know the algae Euglena gracilis with a paper microscope
 * Make stuff by folding algal biomaterials
 * Understand the social relations everyday materials have with non-humans

## Introduction 

This is based on recent research on interdisciplinary work and learning in biomedical science and my experience working as an artist in maker culture and experiments in Biomaterials. As we'll discuss along the way many materials we use and depend on are biomaterials in some way, or at least began to be produced using living or once-living things. My work's usually about setting up making activity people do together to discuss things critically, and it's known as something called critical making.

## Critical Making ü§î üõ†Ô∏è

Critical making is a phrase coined by [Matt Ratto](https://criticalmaking.com/matt-ratto/) and used broadly by other researchers working around maker culture, such as [Garnet Hertz](http://www.conceptlab.com/criticalmaking/), and in the fields of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) that explore things like Biotic Gaming, games that use digital technology and art to play with other organisms, something I call *Interspecies Gaming*. A good example is Raphael Kim's [MouldRush](https://raphael.kim/mould-rush-1).

Critical Making is also a part of the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) which explores the social and political implications of the historical construction of science and technology. STS challenges how our theories and methods, what we think and how we do things, partly shape the world and what it is possible to know about. Critical making really brings these theories and methods together and tries to think like STS *through* making. So today we're doing a bunch of activity to think about the limits and implication of Biomaterials

## Biomaterials ü¶†iüß±

Biomaterials like bioplastic are sustainable alternatives to the plastic materials we use everyday that are connected to fossil fuel use. As we'll see they still are based on extractive processes - like oil, large amounts of living, non-living and once-living things have to be gathered together and processed so you can mix them together and make something new. However they are more sustainable and arguably use alot less carbon and reduce pollution. As we'll see when we make our algae bioplastic, they have advantages and disadvantages  

There are alot of guides to make bioplastics on the web but the  [Materiom Project](https://materiom.org/) project compiles and invites contributions from bioplastic engineers and enthusiasts so that they can standardise the recipes and document their properties, tensile strength, pH, resistance to water etc. Standardisation is a big part of scaling up experimental materials so they start being used in the 'real' world. [Aled Deakin's Bio-hybrid materials](https://www.deakinbio.com) are a great example of small scale experimentation on the edge of scaling up into some kind of manufacturing process. That's the difficult part and maybe one day we can do a workshop on that, 

## Feeling for the Organisms ü¶† ‚ù§Ô∏è

Feeling for the Organisms is a fascinating book by Evelyn Fox Keller about geneticist Barbara McClintock.  When you spend time with materials, especially living material like we all do, you get a complex kind of knowledge about them, than say reading about them in a book. Today we'll get to know the Algae, *Euglena gracilis* by trying to see them with a *Foldscope* microscope, so when we use processed, dehydrated and most importantly *dead* Spirulina to colour our bioplastic later we've actually got a feeling for the organisms and materials we make and then use. I'd argue in our world of advanced capitalism we sometimes lose this kind of intimate relationship with materials. We struggle to find time to build that kind of relationship being too busy to survive and work and look after each other. Maybe we dont need those kind of feelings all of the time, for not all of the materials we use but today I'd like to just imagine what that would be like. If you make stuff, do DIY or your a builder or gardener for example you already have feelings for the materials you work with, so in some ways critical making just builds on that and tries to make time to just think about it a bit more while you are making.


## First Cook ‚öóÔ∏è

All my recipes orginate from the [Materiom](https://materiom.org/) project who are trying to standardise biomaterial recipes from all over the world. My favourite due to ease of use and strength while also being quite forgiving if you recipe ratio's are off, is the [Carrageenan Kappa Ca03 recipe](https://materiom.org/recipe/206)

### Warning ‚ò£Ô∏è

Carrageenan Kappa is derived from Red seaweed so is quite similar to the other once-living material Spirulina Algae. All these ingredients are food grade supplements and established food additives available widely on eBay and in health food shops and the food industry. They are not known to cause allergies but if you are allergic or have reactions to seaweed or marine vegetation please take care and let us know.  We can't guarantee the ingredients might not be contaminated with other food stuffs like gluten or nuts, it depends on the supplier. If you have allergies let us know and seek further information. Basic rule is do not ingest and wash hands after our activity and don't drink the de-ionised water if you've used battery top up water..

## Instructions üìù

### Cooking Guide ‚öóÔ∏è 

I've made lasercut moulds with 3mm clear acrylic and 8mm M4 bolts with M4 butterfly nuts designed to fit  a [Electriq Maxi Food Dehyrdrator](https://www.electriq.co.uk/p/edfd06/electriq-maxi-digital-food-dehydrator-with-6-collapsible-shelves-and-48-hour-timer)

You could imagine other more simple moulds - cake and baking tins and you could dehydrate in a conventional fan oven at 35 degrees celcius. Experiment at your own risk with that - it is hard to control low temperatures with kitchen ovens. The dehydrator is much safer cost under ¬£50 but you need to look for oblong trays like the Electriq 


### Domestic Lab Equipment ‚öóÔ∏è

### Ingredients üõí

All of these ingredients are sourced on eBay and are food grade and non-toxic. Be careful you only get pure Carrageenan Kappa, some suppliers include it with xanthem gum which makes it far too thick for the foldable film we make here.

These are amounts enough to fill one of our moulds to give you 2 sheets of 107mm x 244mm size. The most consistent results have come from half the original amounts listed on Materiom per sheet, one at a time but you could experiment.

**Amount**|**Item**
---|---
175ml|Water<br>(distilled and/or ionised water ideally. Battery top up water works ok)
1ml|Glycerol
1-2g|Carrageenan Kappa 
0.25g|Spirulina Algae


### Step 1 ‚öóÔ∏è 

In a cooking pot or flask and stirring setup, pour 175 ml of water. After that, with a spoon, add little by little 8g of Carrageenan Kappa. You can also use Carrageenan Iota, however this will give you a slight variations in the final material.

Warning: We got lucky with tap water for a few cooks but found tap water to be ionsied and lead to unexpected resulte. Battery top up water about ¬£1 a litre seemed alot more stable. Distilled water might be even better. So ignore my advice in the instructional that tap water will do! 

### Step 2 ‚öóÔ∏è üî•

Turn on the cooker to a high heat and start stirring, ideally with a rubber spatula. You can keep to a low heat if using a magnetic stirrer. Mix constantly and until you have dissolved all the lumps.

### Step 3 üíâ

When the mixture becomes homogeneous, add 2 ml of glycerin. Stir and mix a little longer.

### Step 4 ‚öóÔ∏è üî•üå°Ô∏è

Use a thermometer and heat the mixture to 70¬∫ C. Once at 70¬∫C, remove thermometer and get ready to pour the mix in to your moulds. Let it cool for 30 seconds to help control it. Put pressure on the ring as you pur in as the acrylic bows upwards with the heat, after a minute it should stay flat.

### Step 5 ‚è≤Ô∏è üå°Ô∏è

Dry in a food dehydrator for 11hrs at 35¬∫, but you can also air-dry the poured mix in a baking tray in a dry warm room for 24 hours, or a fan oven on the lowest possible temperature for 4-6hrs. Once the film dries, carefully peel off. 

## Materiom

You can find great [resources on Materiom](https://materiom.org/projects) the open source portal to all things biomaterials. Good luck making them!! Most of them are more than possible to do at home.


## Foldscopes üî¨

[Foldscopes](https://foldscope.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions) are brillinat little kits to see things at 140X magnification or more when combined with a phone. We're going to make them from a kit and then try look at some algae samples I've been growing.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-tFJRGQBIo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

First step is to use a sample slide, provided in your workshop and test your 'scope with that, and once you've seen something clearly by eye and by phone you can move onto preparing your own slides with 'live' samples. This can be tricky but have a look at the videos below to help - I've included footage from a slide I prepared with *Euglena gracilis* in the clear channels I made with PDMS silicon and an old vinyl, right at the bottom.

## Origami Fold designs üìÑ

Finally use the ready - made bioplastic sheet included with your Foldscope kit to experiment with origami style structures. The image below is a folding template - place your sheet over the template and fix with tape then use scissors or a craft knife to every gently score the bioplastic for folding.

The design uses the Huffman Waterbomb Tessalation design from [Origami Simulator](https://origamisimulator.org/). Go on to explore other ways of manipulating sheet materials with another origami resource at [Cut Fold Templates](http://cutfoldtemplates.com)

Good luck out there in the world of Fossil capital and competing bio materials!
